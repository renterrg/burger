# burger

A burger logger built using jQuery, MySQL, Node, Express, Bootstrap and Sequelize. It follows the MVC design pattern, using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and jQuery to generate the HTML. Sequelize is the chosen ORM to configure the set up with Node and MySQL, and finally Boostrap as the front-end design framework.
